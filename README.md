# ECB's monetary policy similarity NLP

1. Data Preparation
Data Collection: Import ECB press conference statements from 1999 to 2013. If this data isn't readily available, you may need to scrape it from the ECB's website or find a suitable dataset.
Preprocessing: Process the text data by converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and employing stemming (using the Porter stemming algorithm).
Tokenization: Convert text into tokens for further analysis.
2. Textual Similarity Analysis
Bigram Creation: Create bigrams from the tokenized text of the ECB statements.
Jaccard Similarity: Calculate the Jaccard similarity between consecutive statements, based on the presence of bigrams.
Trend Analysis: Perform a time-series analysis to examine the trend in similarity over the years.
3. Financial Data Handling
Data Collection: Gather data on the DJEurostoxx50 Index for the corresponding dates of ECB statements.
Calculation of Returns: Compute daily returns and identify the abnormal returns around the announcement dates.
Event Study Methodology: Implement the event study methodology to calculate cumulative abnormal returns (CAR).
4. Market Reaction Analysis
Sentiment Analysis: Apply a dictionary-based approach (Loughran and McDonald’s dictionary) to quantify the sentiment of ECB statements (positive, negative, and neutral terms).
Regression Analysis: Conduct regression analyses to explore the relationship between the similarity of ECB statements, the sentiment, and the market's reaction (abnormal returns).
5. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Provide summaries of the data, such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Correlation Analysis: Examine the correlation between different variables such as sentiment, similarity, and market reaction.
6. Visualization
Trend Plots: Plot the trend of similarity over time.
Correlation Matrices: Visualize the correlation between different variables.
Regression Results: Graphically represent the results of regression analyses.
7. Interpretation and Conclusion
Discuss the results in the context of the ECB’s communication strategy.
Compare your findings with those in the paper.
Draw conclusions about the effectiveness of ECB communication on market learning.
8. Documentation and Comments
Throughout the code, include comments explaining each step.
Document the assumptions, methodologies, and limitations.
9. Testing and Validation
Include tests to validate your results.
Ensure reproducibility by properly managing and citing data sources.
10. Optimization and Refinement
Optimize the code for efficiency, especially if dealing with large datasets.
Refine the analysis based on initial findings, possibly iterating over some of the earlier steps.
Programming Tools and Libraries
Python: Ideal for this type of analysis.
Libraries: nltk for NLP tasks, pandas and numpy for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, statsmodels or scikit-learn for regression analysis.
Final Steps
Review the code for accuracy and adherence to the methodologies used in the paper.
Prepare a report or presentation to summarize the findings and methodologies
